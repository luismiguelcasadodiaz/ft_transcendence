# Description

🇬🇧 The Unyielding Citadel: A Grand Siegebattle
Inspired by the monumental Battle of Cartagena de Indias in 1741, this particular engagement elevates the classic naval duel into a full-scale siege, demanding not merely luck, but the strategic genius and unyielding resolve of a commander such as Admiral Don Blas de Lezo.

The game transforms into a desperate defence of a vital colonial stronghold against an overwhelmingly superior invasion force, mirroring the historical disparity where the Spanish, led by the 'Half-Man'—a title earned through the loss of an eye, a leg, and an arm in service—faced a formidable British Armada under Admiral Vernon.

📜 The Commander's Briefing: 'Lezo's Legacy'
In this variant, the playing field is asymmetrical, consisting of two distinct sections: the Defensive Citadel Grid and the Open Sea Grid.

The Defensive Citadel (Spanish Player): The defending player, embodying the spirit of Don Blas de Lezo, controls a smaller, highly fortified grid representing the Bocachica Channel and the Castillo San Felipe de Barajas. Your 'ships' are no longer mere vessels but fixed fortifications, strategically sunk hulks, and concealed gun batteries. Their placement is fixed and known to both players, for your advantage lies in the terrain, not secrecy.

### Goal: 

To withstand a set number of rounds or destroy a critical mass of the attacking fleet before your own key fortifications are neutralised.

The Open Sea (British Player): The attacking player, representing Admiral Vernon, commands the overwhelming Grand Armada. Their ships are numerous and varied (ships-of-the-line, frigates, transports), placed upon the large Open Sea Grid in secret.

Goal: To successfully land a significant quota of 'Troop Transports' by navigating the defensive channel and destroying the fixed fortifications, culminating in a successful 'Assault on the Castle'.

The Attrition Mechanic: Rather than simple 'Hit or Miss,' a successful attack against a vessel on the Open Sea Grid also triggers a Disease/Sickness Check for the attacker, reflecting the debilitating tropical conditions that ravaged the British forces. This introduces an element of long-term attrition, a key to Lezo's victory.

The Grand Assault: If the attacker succeeds in breaching the channel defences, a final, fixed-coordinate assault is launched against the central fortress (Castillo San Felipe). Here, success depends not only on fire-power but also on the successful landing of ground forces, a nod to the disastrous, confused night attack by the British on the fortress.

### 📝 Strategic Features: A Lesson in Command
This revised framework captures the spirit of the 1741 siege:

Asymmetrical Warfare: The British possess overwhelming force (quantity of ships), but the Spanish possess superior position and tenacity (fixed, powerful defences and terrain advantage). This rewards strategic, rather than brute-force, play.

The Power of Fortification: The Spanish 'ships' are forts and batteries, which take a vastly greater number of hits to disable, forcing the British player into a costly, protracted engagement, a direct reflection of the tenacious defence of Bocachica.

The Disease Factor: A card or dice roll following a 'Hit' by the Spanish forces can randomly reduce the attacking player's available moves or hit capacity on subsequent turns. This is an elegant mechanism to represent the calamitous impact of sickness and low morale that ultimately defeated Vernon.

Victory Coins of Hubris: An optional feature allows the British player to claim victory prematurely and mint a token upon conquering the first minor fort. This is a direct, witty reference to Admiral Vernon’s infamous commemorative medals struck before the Spanish defeat, which had to be hastily recalled after his utter humiliation.

The 'Half-Man's' Tenacity: The Spanish commander gains an increasing bonus to their defensive die rolls as their fortifications fall, embodying Blas de Lezo's indomitable will and determination when his forces were at their lowest ebb.

|field_name|description|
|----------|-----------|
|mc_match_fk (Foreign Key, part of composite Primary Key)|: Reference to the match|
|mc_user_fk (Foreign Key, part of composite Primary Key)|: Reference to the user competing|

|field_name|description|
|----------|-----------|
|f_1 (Foreign Key, part of composite Primary Key)|: First user in the relationship|
|f_2 (Foreign Key, part of composite Primary Key)|: Second user in the relationship|
|f_date|: Date marking either the beginning or ending of the friendship|
|f_tipo|: Boolean flag indicating relationship status (TRUE = friendship established, FALSE = friendship terminated)|

### Key Relationships

+ Users may have multiple friends and belong to multiple organizations (many-to-many)
+ Users participate in matches as competitors (many-to-many through COMPETITOR)
+ Each user has exactly one role, country, language, and status (one-to-one)
+ Matches contain multiple competitors and can have various metrics tracked both at the match level and individual competitor level
+ Metrics can be applied to both entire matches and individual competitor performances within those matches

This structure supports a comprehensive competitive gaming platform with social features, detailed performance tracking, and flexible metric collection at both aggregate and individual levels.
